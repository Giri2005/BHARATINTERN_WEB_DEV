        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Alex Johnson, and I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at ABC University. My passion lies in web development, where I love creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my time at ABC University, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have also gained hands-on experience with frameworks like React and libraries like jQuery. One of my recent projects includes developing a personal portfolio website and a dynamic weather application that uses data from a public API.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to my coursework, I have taken several online courses to further my knowledge, such as the Front-End Web Development course on Coursera. Last summer, I completed an internship at XYZ Tech, where I contributed to developing front-end features for their e-commerce platform.</p>
        
        <p>Aside from coding, I am an active member of the university's Coding Club, where I collaborate with peers on various projects and participate in hackathons. Outside of academics and programming, I enjoy playing basketball, exploring nature trails, and volunteering at the local animal shelter.</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to reach out to me at alex.johnson@example.com or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-johnson" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> for any collaboration opportunities or if you just want to chat about tech!</p>
